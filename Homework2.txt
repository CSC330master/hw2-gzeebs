1. I had to use commands mainly to navigate the directories 
of my computer. the ls command to see what files are in my 
current directory, cd to move to a specific directory,
the mkdir "name" to create the directory are all things 
I had to use for this assignment. Also the pico interactions
as well were things that I had to mess around with to get 
comfortable with. In particular the CTRL + "some sort of key"
to be able to navigate the menu effectively without a mouse 
input. In terms of git, there was the configuration commands for
config user email and name so github can find my VM. There
also was the add, commit, and push commands to verify the 
changes to the document (add), secure the document in the 
local repository (commit), and publish the updated 
repository to the Github server (push). Obviously the way 
I would have had to do that was also by cloning the 
repository onto my VM. *I'm not 100% sure that it will stay 
on my system as a local repository permenantly or if I'll
have to clone the repository each time. I'm not sure.* These
commands were outlined for me in the guide you provided.

2. There has to be a reference page made for submission 
for each homework assignment. This is to protect yourself
from any plagerism cases and to give credit where credit is
due. 

3. We will lose points/have missing assignments in our grade.

4. The penalty of missing class, aside from the attendance 
grade, is the knowledge gap that is created from missing 
lecture where everything is explained. This will cause a 
cascading effect on work and make the assignments 
exponentially harder.
